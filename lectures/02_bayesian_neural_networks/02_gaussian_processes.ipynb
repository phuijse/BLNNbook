    "Before training a neural network (deterministic or probabilistic) we have to **select its architecture**. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), we need to choose the number of layers (depth) and the number of nodes (neurons) per layer (width)\n",
    "\n",
    "> With this we are defining the neural network as a **function with fixed structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the width and depth gives the model more flexibility. But in general we don't know \"how much\" flexibility is needed for a particular problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture is a collection of hyper-parameters. The good practice is to find the \"best structure\" using a validation (holdout) dataset"

    "Instead of testing several architectures we could use a non-parametric model with no fixed structure\n",

    "In this lesson we will study the **Gaussian Process (GP)**, a bayesian non-parametric model that can be seen as a neural network with one hidden layer and potentially infinite width\n",

    "> In general non-parametric models automatically grow in complexity (width) with data\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that non-parametric models do have prior distributions and tunable hyper-parameters. The difference is that the distribution of its parameters lives in an infinite dimensional space. We use non-parametric models by integrating out (marginalizing) this infinite distribution\n",
