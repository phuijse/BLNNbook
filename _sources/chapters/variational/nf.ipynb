    "Normalizing flows (NFs) are likelihood-based generative models, similar to VAE. The main difference is that the marginal likelihood $p(x)$ of VAE is not tractable, hence relying on the ELBO. On the other hand, NF has a tractable marginal likelihood, i.e. we can write a direct expression for $\\max \\log p(x)$\n",

    "In a nutshell NF is a composition of \"simple\" transformations (hence the name flow) applied to a \"simple\" distribution, in order to obtain a more complex distribution.
