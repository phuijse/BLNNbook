# Neural Networks and Bayesian Learning

An ebook on Neural Networks and Bayesian Learning made for the students of the INFO320 course at the [Master on INformatics (MIN) program, UACh](http://magister.inf.uach.cl/). This book is published at http://phuijse.github.io/NNBL and it sources can be found at http://github.com/phuijse/NNBL. This book is constantly evolving. Feel free to contact me via phuijse at inf dot uach dot cl or by writing issues in this repo

**Course abstract**

In this course we will study probabilistic programming techniques that scale to massive datasets (Variational Inference), starting from the fundamentals and also reviewing existing implementations with emphasis on training deep neural network models that have a Bayesian interpretation. The objective is to present the student with the state of the art that lays at the intersection between the fields of Bayesian models and Deep Learning through lectures, paper reviews and practical exercises in Python
